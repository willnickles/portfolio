      I am a dedicated software developer with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science
       from the University of Iowa and a strong foundation in full-stack development. 
       With hands-on experience as both an intern and an associate developer, 
       I have honed my skills in building scalable REST APIs, optimizing database queries, 
       and creating dynamic user interfaces using Angular and Spring Boot. My passion for crafting innovative
       solutions is reflected in projects like a task
       management system leveraging Angular and Django REST Framework. I thrive in collaborative, 
       Agile environments and am eager to tackle challenging problems to drive impactful results.
